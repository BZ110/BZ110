# Hello, Salut, Mr7ba 👋

(Welcome | Bienvenue | Ahlan w Sahlan) to my GitHub page! My name is **Critical**, though you may also know me by my other aliases like **BZ110** or **King**. I'm excited to share my projects, collaborations, and contributions with you all.

## 🚀 About Me | Sur Moi | 3ani

I'm from **Iraq**, and I speak English and Arabic on a conversational level, with French being at a beginner level. I live in **Canada, Toronto** and I just love how expensive everything is here! </3

### 👨‍💻 Languages | Langues | Lughaat

- Programming Languages: PY, JS, TS, HTML, CSS, C#, and Java. (Although I have prior experience with other languages like Lua, and R, I don't apply them that much)
- Tools: Copilot, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and just countless more I forgot to list.

### What Am I Best At? | Qu'est-ce Que Je Fais Bien? | Bi Ay Shi Ana Shater?

- As of right now, I think I've completely dropped AI Development, and I focus more on **Backend Development.**.
- What I also do is try to find solutions for horizontal scaling. (REDIS Sharding, Workload Distribution, Docker, etc)
- I also work with multiple applications and try to merge their functionality for the end-user. Creating relational databases and caches to ensure that data is stored properly for this setup is also nice.
- I also like modding video games! I've been doing it for a while, and it's a fun thing to do.
- One last thing is diving into more complex stuff, like the Windows Operating System. How does it save a file? What services are responsible for this, or that? How can I read things like the $MFT and $J and use them for cybersecurity? Though I won't specialize in this, This is done in my free time.

### 🎮 Hobbies | Loisirs | Hiwayaat

When I'm not coding, you'll find me indulging in these:

- **Hobbies**: Playing Overwatch, Reading Books, Scrolling on Instagram
- **Fun fact**: Otters sometimes hold other otters' pups hostage to force their parents to give up food.
